# DefaultCreditCard_MultivariateAnalysis

Using data about the default of credit cards of real clients, our goal is to inspect,analyze and perform techniques learned in the Multivariate Analysis class in orderto  get  hidden  information  and  transform  this  information  into  knowledge  that could  be  used  in  a  real  project. In  addition  to  that  at  the  end  of  a  project  weshould be able to predict payment capability of a client, whether he/she can pay next month or not.
